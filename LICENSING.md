# Codi Licensing

Codi is available under a **dual-license** model, giving you flexibility in how you use the software.

## Open Source License (AGPL-3.0)

Codi is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the **GNU Affero General Public License** as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This means you can:
- Use Codi freely for personal or commercial purposes
- Modify the source code
- Distribute copies

**With the following requirements:**
- If you distribute Codi or derivative works, you must provide the source code under AGPL-3.0
- If you run a modified version on a server and let users interact with it over a network, you must make the source code available to those users
- Any derivative works must also be licensed under AGPL-3.0

See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for the full AGPL-3.0 text.

## Commercial License

For organizations that want to:
- Use Codi in proprietary software without open-sourcing their code
- Embed Codi in commercial products without AGPL obligations
- Integrate Codi into SaaS platforms without providing source code to users
- Receive priority support and custom development

A commercial license is available. Contact [layne@codi.dev](mailto:layne@codi.dev) for pricing and terms.

## Which License Do I Need?

| Use Case | License Needed |
|----------|----------------|
| Personal use, learning, experimentation | AGPL-3.0 (free) |
| Open source projects (AGPL-compatible) | AGPL-3.0 (free) |
| Internal company use (not distributed) | AGPL-3.0 (free)* |
| SaaS offering with Codi under the hood | Commercial |
| Proprietary desktop/CLI application | Commercial |
| Embedded in closed-source product | Commercial |

*Note: If you modify Codi and allow users to interact with it over a network (even internally), AGPL-3.0 requires you to offer those users the source code.

## Contributing

By contributing to Codi, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same dual-license terms. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

For significant contributions, we may ask you to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to ensure we can continue offering commercial licenses.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Codi at my company without buying a commercial license?**
A: Yes, as long as you comply with AGPL-3.0 terms. If you modify Codi and expose it to users over a network, you must offer them the source code.

**Q: I want to build a product that includes Codi. Do I need a commercial license?**
A: If your product is also open source under AGPL-3.0, no. If your product is proprietary or uses an incompatible license, yes.

**Q: What about plugins or integrations?**
A: Plugins that communicate with Codi through its public API (like MCP tools) may be separately licensed. Plugins that modify Codi's core code are derivative works and must comply with AGPL-3.0 or be commercially licensed.

*This dual-licensing model is similar to those used by MySQL, Qt, MongoDB (formerly), and other successful open source projects.*
